        <p class="paragraph">Robert Whittaker, also known as <b>"The Reaper"</b> is a New-Zealand-born Australian professional mixed martial artist who is currently the #1 ranked middleweight in the UFC. Prior to October of last year Whittaker was the UFC Middleweight World Champion.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">As of today he holds a professional record of 20 wins and 5 losses. 8 of those wins are finishes by a KO(<i>Knockout</i>) or a TKO(<i>Technical Knockout</i>).</p>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">He is one of my favorite MMA fighters of all time because he has a very exciting style of fighting and he is a good person outside of the octagon. He also had an impressive 8 fight win streak on his way to the title.</p>
